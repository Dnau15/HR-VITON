## Proposal idea
In the Virtual Dressing Room project, we aim to revolutionise the online 
shopping experience by leveraging cutting-edge Generative AI models. Our 
primary objective is to empower users to make more informed purchasing 
decisions, all from the comfort of their own homes. \
As a result of our project, we will provide users with the opportunity to 
evaluate, from the comfort of their own home, whether a particular article 
of clothing is suitable for them using a Generative AI model. To achieve 
this, we are going to explore and test various generative neural networks 
and methods, drawing inspiration from renowned research papers. \
The goal is to identify and implement the best-performing model that 
guarantees lifelike fabric draping, accurate fit visualisation, and 
precise representation of colours and patterns. \
Our virtual fitting room will offer a catalogue of clothing items and 
accessories from which users can choose. Users will be able to upload 
photos and select items they want to try on virtually. \
By integrating the latest advancements in AI technology with an unwavering 
commitment to user satisfaction, our Virtual Dressing Room project is 
poised to reshape the way people shop for clothing online, making it not 
just convenient but truly enjoyable and trustworthy.

## Progress check
Train Condition Implementation: \
The train_condition has been successfully implemented by our team, marking a significant milestone in our project. This crucial step lays the foundation for generating clothing styles on various individuals. \

### 1.1 Model Training Progress:

Our efforts in training the model have yielded significant progress. The model is now capable of understanding and learning different conditions, which are essential for generating a wide range of clothing styles. This progress has been achieved through iterative training processes, fine-tuning, and performance evaluation.

### 1.2 Data Preparation:

In preparation for the train_condition phase, we have curated and organized an extensive dataset. This dataset includes a diverse collection of clothing images and pictures of individuals in various conditions and poses. This diverse dataset serves as the basis for the model to learn and adapt effectively.

Train Generator Development: \
The next phase of our project involves developing the train_generator, which is tasked with generating clothing styles on different individuals. To delve deeper into this phase:

### 1.3 User Interface:
Now we use simple command line user interface. The user can select the desired parameters and enter them in the command line


### 2.1 Dataset Utilization:

To effectively harness the potential of our comprehensive dataset, we have undertaken various steps to ensure that it is used optimally. The dataset contains a wide range of clothing images and pictures of individuals with diverse attributes. This variety is essential to produce clothing styles that are not only fashionable but also adaptable to different body types, ages, and preferences.

### 2.2 Data Processing Techniques:

The success of our train_generator hinges on efficient data processing techniques. To facilitate this, we have incorporated data loaders and custom datasets. This approach allows us to efficiently load and preprocess the dataset for model training.

### 2.3 Model Architecture:

In parallel with data processing, we have been working on refining the architecture of the train_generator. This includes the development of neural network models and the integration of various deep learning techniques to ensure the generation of realistic and appealing clothing styles.

### Conclusion:
In summary, our team has achieved significant progress in implementing train_condition and is actively developing train_generator. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset and employing data processing techniques are key components of our project. The successful implementation of these phases will enable us to generate a wide variety of clothing styles for different individuals.
